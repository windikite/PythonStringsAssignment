My 7th assignment! The product review assignment's shorten task had me going in one direction splitting the string into a list of the characters, then going character by character and popping if it wasn't desired. However, I ended up going back and coming up with a much simpler method to shorten a string into the desired length without cutting off any words or ending on an unwanted character that would make it look weird. 

Checking the name input was probably the easiest of the tasks, while the others within the product review were moderate compared to the shortening task.
